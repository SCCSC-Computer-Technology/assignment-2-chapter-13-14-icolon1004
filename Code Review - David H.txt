[] I had no trouble getting the code to compile and populate the database grid on startup with no compiler warnings.

[] The code is very readable with the methods isolated from the button click events.
It is very well documented with comments within every code block. The buttons are given good names.

[] I noticed the button for searching by description is missing its text property, but it is obvious what it does because the layout is consistent.
The product description text property does not clear out when clear button is pressed. Those were the only two real issues.
The try-catch for the price range button throws the same dialog if either text field fails to parse which makes the error a bit ambiguous if it was simply left blank or not a number value.
To fix it would make the code for that method a lot less clean though.

[] My project was a bit different in that I had a seperate solution for each problem.
If I had combined the three sections into one solution I would have likely come up with a similar layout and code structure.
I also did not create a separate class to be passed to my methods, but the implementation here works fine.

[] I found the form layout to be clean and organized. I think the descriptive labels really helped me understand what button does what.
