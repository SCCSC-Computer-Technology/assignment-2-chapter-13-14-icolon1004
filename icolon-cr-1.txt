Positive
-Code is extremely user friendly/well designed/ readable
-Robustness of program is improved by use of try/catch
-Solid understanding of LINQ

Overall
-LINQ is case sensitive by default, you can change that
by using the String.Equals method with the StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase 
option. I think this will improve the overall practicality of the application.
-include partial matches when searching for things like product number.
