The code compiles, and it is well-documented. I believe that there is a lot of redundant code when passing a "ProductClass" object to the various functions.
I think that a more readable approach is to instantiate the "ProductClass" object within many of the functions themselves rather than passing the objects in. In fact, the "ProductClass" class
is simply a wrapper for all possible states that could be needed, and I strongly believe that this adds unnecessary complexity to the code as the purpose of the objects
is not immediately obvious in Form1.cs.

When clicking the clear button, the description label and button text disapear. Otherwise, everything seems to work as intended. One way my code is different is that I store
the results of the user's inputs into variables instead of an object. There are ultimately no performance tradeoffs between the two, but I prefer my approach because 
it is more obvious what I am doing with the user's inputs.
