I liked the way you had this broken up for readability. I did find that the button for searching by product description would blank out if you hit the clear button. This is likely due to the clear button clearing “searchForProductDescriptionContainingSpecificTextButton.Text” instead of “searchForProductDescriptionContainingTextBox.Text”. I assume this was simply the autofill at work, perhaps shortened button and textbox names would help in the future, but I also tend to use fairly long names to help keep them distinct and easy to quickly find/remember.

Since there are so many buttons and options in a form like this I opted to have the enter button do nothing. We’re all fairly conditioned to hit enter immediately after entering text into a field and I found that I cleared the form a lot by accident.

Searching by description works, but is case sensitive. I like to make sure that users can type in text in any casing and still be able to find what they are searching for, this allows you to search for “par” and still have the program locate the “Parka” item. I think this can help reduce user frustration and fatigue when using a program to look things up. This is especially true if something like this would be implemented as a new system.

I found it interesting that you made a class for the product data. I think that’s smart and can be used in a variety of ways. It would also allow the code to be scaled up more easily to include data entry features. It is always good as a program to think about future development or a program and taking 5-10 extra minutes now could end up saving you hours of reworking later. By making the class I think you left yourself in a great place to expand this program going forward and is something I will consider doing myself going forward.
